## Enable cross origin resource sharing

To use this app you will need the [Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: \*](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi) Chorme extention. Use this extention to "Enable cross origin resource sharing".

Then remove the default value at "Intercepted URLâ€™s or URL patterns" and add `*://moneybird.com/*`, to make sure that both the Harvest and MoneyBird API are accessible from your local machine.
